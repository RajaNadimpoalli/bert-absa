# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This project implements and evaluates a fine-tuned BERT model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using a simulated version of the Amazon Polarity dataset. It classifies review sentiments based on specific product aspects such as battery, design, or performance.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Model**: `bert-base-uncased` fine-tuned for 3-class sentiment classification (Negative, Neutral, Positive)
- **Architecture**: BERT encoder with a linear classifier on [CLS] token
- **Data**: Amazon Polarity dataset (subset of 3,000 reviews)
- **Tracking**: Training progress visualized using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/)
- **Platform**: Developed and tested on Google Colab (T4 GPU)

## üß† Model Training

- Input format: `[aspect]: review text`
- Tokenizer: `bert-base-uncased` (max length = 128)
- Optimizer: AdamW (learning rate = 5e-5)
- Batch size: 8, Epochs: 3
- Loss: Cross-entropy
- Metrics: Accuracy and weighted F1-score

## üìä Results

| Metric              | Value     |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Validation Accuracy | ~80%      |
| F1 Score (weighted) | ~0.78     |
| Evaluation Loss     | 0.44      |

Example prediction format:
```python
Aspect: battery | Sentiment: Positive | Review: "The battery lasts all day and charges quickly."
